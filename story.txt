A few days for Spring break, she was packing to go home to her family for a week and come back to school to finish out the semester.
Right before Spring break, she found out that she was going to have to stay at home for two additional weeks.
At the end of the first week of online classes, while she was outside with her family, she found out she was going to be staying home and doing online classes for the rest of the semester.
While she understood why, she was very disappointed to not be able to go back to campus to see her friends for the rest of the semester.
