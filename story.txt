A few days for Spring break, she was packing to go home to her family for a week and come back to school to finish out the semester.
Right before Spring break, she found out that she was going to have to stay at home for two additional weeks.
At the end of the first week of online classes, while she was outside with her family, she found out she was going to be staying home and doing online classes for the rest of the semester.
While she understood why, she was very disappointed to not be able to go back to campus to see her friends for the rest of the semester.

As she watched lecture after lectur and completed homework after homework the days begane to blur together.
At the start of the lockdown she thought of it as annoying and inconvinient but as the days passed by it became the new normal.
No longer did she forget to wear a mask before heading outside. No longer did it hurt to not be around friends.
She still missed old life a lot and would rather have it back for anything but at the very least it is no longer unbearebale to live in this new reality.
